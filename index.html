				<h4>09/2002 - 09/2003</h4>

				<p>I have joined a team at O'Neil &amp; Associates to help with
					converting an application from Access database into environment
					that utilized Java, Oracle and Epic Editor for a client in
					aerospace industry. Access application was a content management
					system and contained around 300 forms and around 250 subforms. I
					was initially charged with developing an Administrative module to
					support the newly converted application (XiBase). I regularly went
					above and beyond my duties, working 10-12 hour days, to meet
					project deadlines. During the development process, I have been
					trained in and learned on my own several technologies required for
					the project such as SGML, Epic Editor, Java Swing, Oracle's IFS
					content management system, Eclipse IDE and log4j. At the same time,
					my Java expertise soared. The load of knowledge was so great that
					after leaving, I have immediately attained Sun Certified Programmer
					for Java 1.4 certification without any significant additional
					studying.</p>

				<h4>01/2001 - 09/2002</h4>

				<p>As an associate developer, I have joined team of programmers
					to maintain Relizon's order-entry system (SA - Sales Advantage). I
					was trained to program with Powerbuilder and work with Sybase
					database. At the end of several months of successful maintenance of
					SA, my responsibilities have been expanded to support an
					application, called Passport, that was a front-end to the database
					of vendors. I have mastered ASP and Microsoft SQL Server while
					working on it. After having a chance to study the business and how
					it was maintained, I have proposed and developed idea for Admin
					tool to support order-entry application. This has allowed me to
					move into Java direction and I was able to learn the following Java
					technologies: JDBC, Servlets and JSPs.</p>
